# UA Rebuild — Public Recovery & Contribution Memory Layer for Ukraine

**[uarebuild.org](https://uarebuild.org)** · Pilot 

A public system that records, verifies, and archives humanitarian and reconstruction contributions across Ukraine. Every donation, volunteer action, and rebuilt community — permanently recorded and independently verifiable via BNB Chain.

---

## What it is

UA Rebuild is a **civic recognition and verification platform**, not a reconstruction map.

It combines:
- **Wall of Rebuilders** — a public honor archive of verified contributors (NGOs, donors, volunteer groups)
- **Community Recovery Feed** — living recovery stories from 1,673 Ukrainian communities
- **On-chain verification** — records anchored to BNB Chain, publicly auditable on BscScan
- **AI-assisted queries** — natural language Q&A over community and contribution data (Groq API)

The goal: a permanent public record that cannot be revised, deleted, or forgotten.

---

## The problem it solves

Over $47B in international aid committed to Ukraine reconstruction — with no unified public accountability layer. OCHA, UNHCR, government registries, and NGO reports exist in silos. There is no tool that makes this data accessible, verifiable, and permanent at community level.

UA Rebuild is the missing layer on top of existing data sources.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Target | Milestones |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 3 months | Aug 2026 | Mainnet deploy, 30–50 on-chain records, verification pipeline |
| 6 months | Nov 2026 | 100–200 records, first real NGO partners, automation spec |

## Competitive landscape

| Platform | Focus | Gap |
|----------|-------|-----|
| DREAM | State project registry | Not public until 2027, no AI/blockchain |
| Big Recovery Portal | Object-level monitoring | No AI analytics, no on-chain verification |
| Antikorruptsiynyy Shtab map | Damaged buildings registry | No open data aggregation, no analytics layer |
| **UA Rebuild** | **Public civic memory + verification** | Fills the gap: AI queries + immutable on-chain proof |
